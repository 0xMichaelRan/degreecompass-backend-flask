# Setup

Use poetry to manage dependencies:

```
poetry new flask-degree-compass
cd flask-degree-compass
poetry add flask
vi app.py
poetry run flask run
```

Config environment in VS Code:

Cmd + Shift + P, "Python Select Interpreter", and choose Poetry (with Python 3.11.X).

## TODO

Need a docker-compose file to run the database.
